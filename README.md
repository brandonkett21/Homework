Changes

Changed title to Horiseon

Added div id to Search Engine Optimization to allow the link to work properly

Simplified this <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1> to this <h1>Horiseon</h1>

Moved header lines up to "head" away from "body"

Eliminated lines that were the same in CSS by either creating a new class for them or simply just putting them under h2, img, h3, etc...
